Analog processing of data from the headset.

Everything here is placed without warranty or gaurantee of correctness. Code for the paper itself was a derivative of this work. 

The Python script here is designed to process raw data from an AudioDAQ-based peripheral and create a plot.

The additional code to run this as a HTTP service and integrate speech recognition into it will be posted at a later time.
